// Milestone 1: Read the csv file. Define a structure and load the values into objects. Hint: https://github.com/gocarina/gocsv

func main() {

}

// Milestone 2: Create a job(logic to calculate car with max magic value)
// Milestone 3: Create a workpool. Spawn n number of go routines and pass m number of records to process. Each job(routine) can calculate the max value and corresponding car name with the batch of values it processed.
// Milestone 4: Wait for all jobs to complete.
// Milestone 5: Given that each job has calculated individual max magic value, find a way to get the aggregated max.
// Milestone 6: Implement a jobs count limiter. There should be hold on max number of jobs that can run concurrently at a time.
// Milestone 7: Make workpool related code as separate package. You can design the package such that any csv file should work (given structure definition) and any logic should work.
